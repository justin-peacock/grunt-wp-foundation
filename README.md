# grunt-wp-foundation

> Create a WordPress theme with [grunt-init][].

[grunt-init]: http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding

## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init][].

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

### Linux/Mac Users

```
git clone git@github.com:mrdink/grunt-wp-foundation.git ~/.grunt-init/wp-foundation
```

### Windows Users

```
git clone git@github.com:mrdink/grunt-wp-foundation.git %USERPROFILE%/.grunt-init/wp-foundation
```

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init wp-foundation
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._

Install the NPM modules required to actually process your newly-created project by running:

```
npm install
```
